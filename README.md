# vendeps

**One ESM file per dependency, ready for the browser.**
Vendor your dependencies for added reliability, security and simplicity.

`vendeps` reads the `dependencies` in your `package.json`, uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to bundle each one into a single ESM file, and drops the results into a `dependencies/` folder. Your browser code can then import them with plain `import` statements — no bundler, no build step, no CDN required.

```js
import { html, render } from './dependencies/lit-html.js'
import confetti from './dependencies/canvas-confetti.js'
```

## Why?

Modern browsers support ES modules natively, but most npm packages still ship CommonJS or split their code across dozens of files. Using a CDN solves the format problem but introduces new ones:

- **Security** — Every page load fetches code from a third-party server, opening the door to supply-chain, man-in-the-middle, and XSS attacks.
- **Reliability** — Your app's uptime becomes coupled to the CDN's uptime (and if you depend on multiple CDNs, [it's even worse](https://blog.alexewerlof.com/p/composite-slo)).
- **Reproducibility** — CDN URLs can change, disappear, or serve different versions.
- **Predictability** — You don't always know exactly what code your users are running.

`vendeps` takes a different approach: convert each dependency into a single, self-contained `.js` file that you **check into your repository**. Your app ships everything it needs — no external requests at runtime to other servers, no surprises.

- **Security** — Vendeps allows you to version-control your dependencies for audit.
- **Reliability** — Vendeps decouples your app's uptime from external CDNs.
- **Reproducibility** — Vendeps ensures that your app always uses the same version of a dependency.
- **Predictability** — Vendeps ensures that the exact same dependency you used during development is used in production.

## Quick Start

No installation required. In any project that has a `package.json` with `dependencies`:

```bash
npx vendeps
```

That's it. A `dependencies/` folder appears with one `.js` file per dependency. Point your `<script type="module">` at them and go.

### npm scripts

If you prefer to install it as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev vendeps
```

And then:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "build": "vendeps"
    }
}
```

If you want it to run automatically after `npm install`, you can add a `postinstall` script:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "postinstall": "vendeps"
    }
}
```

⚠️ **Dependency drift** — The vendored bundles are snapshots of whatever versions are installed at build time. If you update a dependency version in `package.json` (or run `npm update`), remember to re-run `npx vendeps` (or trigger a fresh `npm ci`) so the bundles stay in sync. Checking in the `dependencies/` folder helps catch drift — any version bump will show up as a diff in your commit.

ℹ️ **Optional vendor check in** It is recommended to check in the `dependencies/` folder to version control but it's not a requirement for vendeps to work. All it does is to create bundles for your dependencies. So you may as well `.gitignore` the `dependencies/` folder and rely on `postinstall` to create the bundles after `npm install` or `npm ci`.

### Import Maps

Instead of rewriting your imports to point at `./dependencies/**/*.js`, you can use a [browser import map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script/type/importmap) so your source code keeps using bare specifiers — exactly like Node.js:

```html
<script type="importmap">
    {
        "imports": {
            "lit-html": "./dependencies/lit-html.js",
            "canvas-confetti": "./dependencies/canvas-confetti.js"
        }
    }
</script>
<script type="module" src="app.js"></script>
```

Now your application code works without any path changes:

```js
// app.js — same imports you'd write in Node
import { html, render } from 'lit-html'
import confetti from 'canvas-confetti'
```

The browser resolves the bare specifiers through the import map, so your code stays portable between Node.js and the browser with zero modifications.

## CLI Options

```
npx vendeps [options]
```

| Option           | Description                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--minify`       | Minify the output bundles.                                                                               |
| `--target <dir>` | Output to `<dir>/` instead of the default `dependencies/`. The directory is created if it doesn't exist. |
| `--src <file>`   | Path to the `package.json` file (defaults to `./package.json`).                                          |
| `--help`         | Show usage information and exit.                                                                         |

### Examples

```bash
# Bundle everything into dependencies/
npx vendeps

# Minified bundles
npx vendeps --minify

# Output to a custom folder
npx vendeps --target vendor

# Combine options
npx vendeps --minify --target lib/vendor
```

## Per-Dependency Configuration

By default, `vendeps` re-exports everything from each dependency:

```js
// generated: export * from 'some-package'
```

You can customize this behavior per-dependency via the `"vendeps"` key in your `package.json`:

```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "lit-html": "^3.0.0",
        "chart.js": "^4.0.0",
        "onnxruntime-node": "1.24.2",
        "@huggingface/transformers": "^3.0.0"
    },
    "vendeps": {
        // Skip generating bundles for this node-only package in an isomorphic project
        "onnxruntime-node": null,
        // Only export Chart from chart.js and define PRODUCTION
        "chart.js": {
            "export": "{ Chart }",
            "define": ["PRODUCTION"]
        }
    }
}
```

### Config Options

| Config value        | Effect                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| _(not set)_         | Default — `export * from '<packageName>'`               |
| `null` or `false`   | **Skip** this dependency entirely.                      |
| `"path/to/file.js"` | Use a custom import source instead of the package name. |
| `{ ... }`           | Full configuration object (see below).                  |

### Full Config Object

| Key      | Type                   | Default      | Description                                                                                                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `from`   | `string`               | package name | The import source path.                                                                                                        |
| `export` | `string`               | `"*"`        | The export style, e.g. `"*"`, `"{ Chart }"`, `"default"`.                                                                      |
| `define` | `object` or `string[]` | `{}`         | [esbuild `define`](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#define) replacements. When an array of strings, each is defined as `"true"`. |

### Scoped Packages

Scoped packages like `@huggingface/transformers` are output with their scope directory preserved:

```
dependencies/@huggingface/transformers.js
```

Import them the same way:

```js
import { pipeline } from './dependencies/@huggingface/transformers.js'
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Add your npm dependencies** as usual with `npm install`.
2. **Run `npx vendeps`** (or let `postinstall` handle it).
3. **Check in the `dependencies/` folder** to version control.
4. **Import from `dependencies/`** in your browser JS files.

```
my-project/
├── package.json
├── dependencies/       ← checked into git
│   ├── lit-html.js
│   ├── canvas-confetti.js
│   └── @huggingface/
│       └── transformers.js
├── index.html
└── app.js              ← import from ./dependencies/
```

By committing the `dependencies/` folder, you get:

- **Self-contained deployments** — no install step needed on the server, no external fetches at runtime.
- **No CDN dependency** — your app works even if every CDN on the internet goes down.
- **Auditability** — the exact code your users receive is visible in your repo.
- **Reproducibility** — every clone, every checkout, every deploy uses the exact same dependency code.

## Limitations

> ⚠️ **CSS-only packages** — `vendeps` bundles JavaScript only. If a dependency ships exclusively CSS (e.g. `normalize.css`), it will not be handled. You will need to copy those assets manually or use a separate tool.
